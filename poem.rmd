In an evening of July â€”  
Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,

Mother doesn't want a dog.  
Mother says they smell,  
And never sit when you say sit,  
Or even when you yell.  
  
When you come home late at night  
And there is ice and snow,  
You have to go back ou because  
The dumb dog has to go.  
  
Mother doesn't want a dog.  
Mother says they shed,  
And always let the strangers in  
And bark at friends instead  
  
They do disgraceful things on rugs,  
And track mud on the floor,  
And flop upon your bed at night  
And snore their doggy snore.  
  
Mother doesn't want a dog.  
She's making a mistake.  
Because, more than a dog, I think  
She will not want this snake.
